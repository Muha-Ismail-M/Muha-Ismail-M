## 👨‍💻 About Me

I build **software systems that model real-world problems**, with a focus on system architecture, performance, and secure engineering practices.

My interests sit at the intersection of:

* Software Engineering & System Design
* Simulation & Modeling
* Real-Time Graphics & Interactive Systems
* Security-Conscious Application Development

I enjoy transforming complex ideas into structured systems — from simulation engines to full-stack platforms and 3D interactive applications.
